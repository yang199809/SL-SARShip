# SL-SARShip
MBLKNet: A Large Kernel Convolution-Driven Network with Multi-Task Self-Supervised Learning for SAR Maritime Target Classification

A multi-resolution unlabeled SAR maritime target dataset SL-SARShip is developed to support multi-task self-supervised pre-training. The data for SL-SARShip is sourced from three publicly available SAR ship detection datasets: SAR-Ship-Dataset, HRSID, and LS-SSDD-v1.0.
